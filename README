Test data for TEON <https://wakaba.github.io/spec-teon/>.

* File

  *.dat - Test data file

* Test data format

Test data are encoded in the format similar to HTML parser test data,
as described in
<https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Parser_tests#Tree_Construction_Tests>.

Parser implementations:

  - Perl <https://github.com/wakaba/testdataparser>
  - JavaScript <https://github.com/wakaba/samijs/blob/master/sami/script/sami-test.js>

Fields:

  #data
  Input data (a TEON text)
  #parsed
  Parsed TEON document encoded in JSON
  #serialized
  Re-serialized parsed TEON document (a TEON text)

The JSON text in the #parsed field is a JSON object with three
name/value pairs: |scalars|, |enums|, and |lists|.

The |scalars| value is an object where names are scalar field names
and values are corresponding field values.

The |enums| value is an object where names are enumeration field names
and values are corresponding field values, represented as objects
where names are values in the set of the field value and values are
number "1".

The |lists| value is an object where names are scalar field names and
values are corresponding field values, represented as arrays where
items are values in the list of the field value.
